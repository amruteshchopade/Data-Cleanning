# PrepInsta Winter Internship - Week 3 Recap

## Summary
In the third week of the PrepInsta Winter Internship, the focus was on mastering data cleaning and manipulation techniques using Pandas in Python. The primary objective was to ensure the integrity and consistency of the Chipotle dataset for subsequent analysis.

## Assignment Highlights

### Data Cleaning
1. **Handling Missing Values:**
   - Identified and proposed strategies for dealing with missing values in key columns (Order ID, Quantity, Item Name, Choice Description, Item Price).

2. **Data Types Validation:**
   - Reviewed and adjusted data types for columns to align with expected types.

3. **Managing Duplicated Entries:**
   - Detected and addressed duplicated entries within the dataset, highlighting potential impacts on analysis.

4. **Quantity and Item Price Examination:**
   - Investigated Quantity and Item Price columns for inconsistencies or anomalies requiring correction.

5. **Analyzing Choice Description:**
   - Explored the Choice Description column, addressing multiple descriptions for a single item.

6. **Special Character Handling:**
   - Proposed strategies for ensuring consistency in text-based columns by identifying and managing special characters.

7. **Order ID Verification:**
   - Cross-referenced the Order ID column for irregularities or patterns necessitating validation.

8. **Standardizing Item Names:**
   - Unified variations in the Item Name column for improved analysis.

9. **Quantity and Price Relationships:**
   - Explored relationships between Quantity and Item Price, evaluating the need for adjustments.

10. **Data Integrity Check:**
    - Ensured the alignment of quantities and prices with corresponding items and descriptions for overall data integrity.

### Additional Tasks
- **Handling Categorical Data:**
  - Encoded or transformed categorical columns, such as Item Name, to make them suitable for analysis.

- **Consistency in Quantity and Price Units:**
  - Ensured uniformity in Quantity and Item Price units, considering necessary conversions or adjustments.

## Conclusion
Week 3's assignments provided a thorough foundation in data cleaning using Pandas. The efforts invested in preparing the Chipotle dataset will serve as a solid base for subsequent analyses. Looking forward to more exciting data explorations and analyses in Week 4!
